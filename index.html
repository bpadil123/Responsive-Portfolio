        <p>Hello World! I'm sure that gets old... Welcome to my portfolio. I was born and raised in a small beautiful town in
            New Mexico, Santa Fe. I obtained my Bachelors in Operations & Markering just an hour from home at the University
            of New Mexico in Albuquerque. I have worked with Fortune 500 companies since I was a sophmore in college. From
            providing tech support at Apple to working in Project Management at HP Inc, I have had my fair share of fun with
            Corporate America. I am a seeker of new knowledge which has brought me to the development world.</p>
        <p>Outside of my professional life, you can find me mountain biking, running, dancing at concerts, and crusing the city
            on my road bike. I love the outdoors, although you can occasionally find me binging a television series from
            time to time. Music is the soundtrack to life and I hold my tunes dearly as I work and play.</p>
        <p>My infatuation with technology has never been so difficult until I began programming. That is what excites me to
            walk this journey of creation and frustration! My passion to build and create is growing by the day as new material
            is being shoved at me. Perhaps I will travel the world and work with a diverse range of indiduals, or simply
            continue to sit at a desk potentially work on something exciting. I like the flexibility and freedom of what
            leis ahead! To that, I say cheers devlopers! </p>
